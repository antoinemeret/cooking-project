# Product Requirements Document: Conversational Recipe Planning Assistant

## Introduction/Overview

The Conversational Recipe Planning Assistant is an AI-driven feature that enables users to plan their weekly meals through natural language conversation. Users describe their meal planning needs via text chat, and the system recommends recipes from their existing collection, supports iterative selection/refusal, and outputs a consolidated meal planner with grocery list. This feature aims to minimize cognitive load in meal planning while maximizing user satisfaction and recipe utilization.

- Boost average recipes prepared per user from their saved collection by 20%
- Drive higher retention through sticky meal-planning features (measured as DAU/WAU uplift)
- Improve user satisfaction and app store ratings related to meal-planning flow

### User Goals
- Minimize time and cognitive load spent choosing what to cook every week/day
- Receive personalized, high-quality recipe suggestions that match their preferences and needs
- Reduce food waste through better meal planning
- Feel in control and inspired, with the ability to clarify, iterate, and adapt the plan as needed
- Track upcoming meals and ingredients to shop in an organized, accessible way

## User Stories

### Primary User Stories
1. **As a busy parent**, I want to quickly describe my weekly meal needs so that I can get recipe suggestions without spending 30 minutes browsing through my saved recipes.

2. **As a home cook with dietary restrictions**, I want to tell the assistant about my constraints (vegetarian, no nuts, etc.) so that I only see relevant recipes from my collection.

3. **As someone planning for guests**, I want to specify special occasions in my meal planning so that the assistant can suggest appropriate recipes for entertaining.

4. **As a meal planner**, I want to accept or decline suggested recipes so that I can build a customized weekly menu that fits my preferences.

5. **As a grocery shopper**, I want a consolidated ingredient list from my planned meals so that I can shop efficiently without missing items or buying duplicates.

6. **As a weekly meal tracker**, I want to check off completed meals so that I can stay organized and see my progress through the week.

### Secondary User Stories
7. **As a new user with few recipes**, I want guidance on building my recipe collection so that the assistant becomes more useful over time.

8. **As a mobile user in the kitchen**, I want a responsive interface that works well on my phone and tablet so that I can access my meal plan while cooking.
