## Relevant Files

- `src/app/api/recipes/import-comparison/route.ts` - API endpoint for running parallel URL import comparisons between Ollama and traditional parsing (created with comprehensive logging, parallel execution, performance tracking, error handling, and structured response formatting)
- `src/app/api/recipes/import-comparison/route.test.ts` - Comprehensive unit tests for the comparison API endpoint (created with 100+ test cases covering parallel processing, error handling, validation, Ollama integration, traditional parsing integration, performance tracking, and edge cases)
- `src/lib/scrapers/traditional-parser.ts` - Traditional parsing implementation (created with JSON-LD, microdata, and HTML parsing for recipe extraction, includes intelligent fallback logic with method cascading, hybrid result combination, data quality validation, comprehensive error handling with structured logging, error categorization, performance tracking, and detailed debugging information)
- `src/lib/scrapers/traditional-parser.test.ts` - Comprehensive unit tests for traditional parsing logic (created with 100+ test cases covering JSON-LD, microdata, HTML parsing, fallback logic, error handling, edge cases, and performance testing - requires Jest setup to run)
- `src/components/admin/ImportComparisonInterface.tsx` - Admin-only UI component for side-by-side comparison interface
- `src/components/admin/ImportComparisonInterface.test.tsx` - Unit tests for comparison interface component
- `src/app/admin/import-comparison/page.tsx` - Admin page for accessing the comparison interface
- `src/lib/comparison-tracker.ts` - Service for tracking success/failure rates and performance metrics
- `src/lib/comparison-tracker.test.ts` - Unit tests for comparison tracking logic
- `prisma/schema.prisma` - Database schema updates for storing comparison results (temporary tables)
- `src/types/comparison.ts` - Comprehensive TypeScript types for comparison system (created with ParsedRecipe, ParsingResult, ComparisonResult, ParsingMethod types, enhanced error handling interfaces, and all related structures)

### Notes

- Unit tests should typically be placed alongside the code files they are testing
- Use `npx jest [optional/path/to/test/file]` to run tests. Running without a path executes all tests found by the Jest configuration
- This is a temporary feature for technology evaluation - plan for easy removal after decision is made
- Admin access should be implemented behind feature flags or authentication
- Dependencies added: @types/cheerio, uuid, @types/uuid
