## Key Technical Decisions

### AI Integration Approach
- **Service**: Claude Sonnet 4 via Anthropic API
- **Framework**: LangChain for conversation management
- **Streaming**: Real-time response streaming for better UX
- **Context**: Session-based conversation memory (no persistent history in V1)

### Database Strategy
- **Extension**: Extend existing Recipe schema rather than separate tables
- **Meal Plans**: Separate tables for meal planning state
- **Grocery Lists**: JSON storage for flexibility with ingredient aggregation
- **Performance**: Indexed queries for filtering recipes by dietary restrictions and seasonality

### Mobile-First Design
- **Navigation**: Four-tab bottom navigation for thumb-friendly access (ü§å Recipes, üí¨ Assistant, üìã Planner, üõí Groceries)
- **Touch Targets**: Minimum 44px for all interactive elements
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first with tablet adaptations
- **Offline**: Basic offline support for viewing existing plans
